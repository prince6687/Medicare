# Sanjeevani :health_worker:
# Made by Prince Verma  
### Project made under AVISHKAR 2k21 :trophy: :1st_place_medal:

## Problem Statement- :question:
  We are required to made a website which **allows doctors, patients and hospitals to login / signup**. Patient should be able to **take appointments, upload reports, make voice, video calls**
  to the doctor (after appointment). 
  *Doctors can keep secret notes for patients*, can **update patient's condition**.
  Patients can see their **nearby hospitals, labs, clinics**, etc. and then take appointments.
  
## How we did it? :sunglasses: :heavy_check_mark:
  1. Used React and tailwind for frontend.
  1. Used Node & express in the backend, MongoDb for the database.
  1. Used Mapbox for creating maps, nodemailer for sending mails, mongoose for modelling data, jsonwebtoken, cookie-parser for handling cookies, bcrypt for hashing password, nodemon as development dependency for running backend server.
 
## How to run it on your local :computer: :desktop_computer: -
  1. Clone this repository  
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/codechampriyanshu/Sanjeevani.git
    ```
    
  1. Run following command in both frontend and backend directory 
     
     ``` js
     npm i
     ``` 
  1. Run the servers by running following command in both backend and frontend-
  ``` js
  npm start
  ```
   You are done. :clap: Start exploring :+1:
  
  ## Challenges we faced :warning:-
  1. Some of us were new to various tech stacks like react, and mongoDB, so it was a big challenge, and we grabbed this opportunity with both hands.
  2. We also learnt various new things like mapbox, nodemailer, etc.. this was very fascinating too.
  3. We don't think it is worth mentioning here or not, but we have been to our college for the first time, after a long wait, during this avishkar period and it was a challenge for us to remain focussed on project. There were so many distractions and all.
  
  ## Future goals :soon:
  1. OfCourse, we would love to take the project to the production level.
  2. We will use real and verified data instead of randomly generated data (for hospitals, ambulances, etc.)
  3. We will increase accessebility of our website for colour blinds as well as for screen readers.
  4. We will add live ambulance tracking facility, this will help patients a lot.
  5. We will improve audio/ video call system.
 
 ## Thankyou :pray:
